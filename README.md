फक्त सांग 👌

Mangaon, Raigad, Maharashtra, India thane la ahe 

Good catch 👍

Mangaon is NOT in Thane.
It is in Raigad district, Maharashtra.

So your correct location line should be:

📍 Mangaon, Raigad, Maharashtra, India

Not Thane ❌

If you want a more professional format, you can also write:

📍 Mangaon, Raigad | Navi Mumbai–Thane, Maharashtra, India

That is 100% correct and professional ✅

If you want, I can also suggest whether to keep full address or just “Maharashtra, India” for better job applications.

add location thane navi mumbai as 

Got it 👍
If you want to show Thane / Navi Mumbai for job & professional visibility, you can write it like this (which is acceptable and professional):

✅ Best Professional Option (Recommended)

📍 Mangaon (Raigad) | Navi Mumbai – Thane Region, Maharashtra, India

✅ Short & Clean Version (LinkedIn / Resume)

📍 Navi Mumbai – Thane Region, Maharashtra, India

✅ Detailed Version (GitHub / Resume Header)

📍 Mangaon, Raigad | Navi Mumbai–Thane, Maharashtra, India

❌ Avoid Writing

❌ Mangaon, Thane (incorrect)

❌ Raigad, Thane (incorrect district)

💡 Why this is okay

Mangaon is in Raigad district

Navi Mumbai & Thane are nearest IT job hubs

HR understands region-based location

If you want, I can update your full profile text with the best location line included.
